Using the ``word processing'' method,
since we've showed that $\gamma = \alpha_1\beta_1\cdots$ where
$\alpha_i \subset U', \beta_i \subset U''$.
So actually we're saying that
\[
\gamma = i'_\sharp (\alpha_1) i''_\sharp(\beta_1)\cdots
\]
if we some $\delta \subset U' \cap U''$,
then the conjugate of $i'_\sharp(\delta) i''_\sharp(\delta)^{-1}$ can
change $\cdots i'_\sharp(\delta) \cdots$ to $\cdots i''_\sharp(\delta) \cdots$.

Thus if $\gamma$ is in the kernel, it can indeed be written as a product
of conjugates of $i'_\sharp(\delta) i''_\sharp(\delta)^{-1}$.

\begin{remark}
    A more frequently used version is that $W$ is a strong deformation kernel
	of some open neighborhood in $X$.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
    For any finite representation of a group
	\[
	G = \left<x_1,\dots,x_n \mid R_1,\dots, R_n \right>,
	\]
	$G$ can be realized as the fundamental groups of a space:
	Let $X$ be a CW-complex with a single 0-cell,
	$n$ 1-cells corresponding to $x_i$, and $m$ 2-cells corresponding to $R_i$.
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
    The path connected condition of $W$ can't be removed,
	e.g. two segments can fuse to $S^1$.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
    Let $f: S\to S$ be a homeomorphism, where $S$ is a closed surface.
	Consider the \textit{mapping torus}:
	\[
		M_f = S \times [0, 1] / \sim,
	\]
	where $(0, 0)\sim (f(x), 1)$.

	Let $Y = S \times \{0\} \cup (\{x_0\} \times  [0, 1])$, $U'$ is an open
	neighborhood of $Y$, $U'' = M_f \backslash Y$.

	Observe that $U' \simeq S \vee circle$, and $U'' \simeq (S \backslash disk)
	\times (\varepsilon, 1 - \varepsilon) \simeq S \backslash disk$.

	\[
	\pi_1(M_f) \cong \pi_1(X) * \left<t \right> / (g\sim tf_\sharp(g) t^{-1})
	\cong \pi_1(S)\rtimes_{f_\sharp} \left<t \right>
	\]
\end{example}

Seifent-vanKampen:
if $i'_\sharp, i''_\sharp$ are both injective, then $j'_\sharp, j''_\sharp$ are
also injective.

Next we'll see some applications of fundamental groups:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bronwer fixed point theorem: A continuous map $f: D^n \to D^n$ must
		have a fixed point.
	\item Invariance of the boundary: If $x\in X$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic
		to $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\times [0, +\infty)$, s.t.
		$x\in \mathbb{R}^{n-1} \times \{0\}$, then $x$ doesn't have a neighborhood
		homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
	\item Invariance of regions: If $U \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ open,
		$f: U\to \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a continuous injection,
		then $f(U)$ is also open, i.e. $f: U\to f(U)$ is a homeomorphism.
\end{itemize}

Here we can only prove the case $n = 2$, since the complete proof
need homotopy groups of rank $n$ (i.e. $\pi_n$), but here we only introduced $\pi_1$.
However, the idea is nearly identical.

\begin{proof}[Proof]
    Assmue by contradiction that $f$ has no fixed points,
	let $g(x) = \frac{x-f(x)}{\lVert x - f(x) \rVert}$,
	then $g: D^n \to S^{n-1}$ is a deformation.
	Thus $g_\sharp: \pi_1(D^2) \to \pi_1(S^1)$ surjective,
	but $\pi_1(D^2) = \{1\}, \pi_1(S^1) = \mathbb{Z}$, contradiction!
\end{proof}
