Here we explain the above computation a little.

The vector
\[
\sum_{\gamma} \Gamma^\gamma_{\_\alpha\beta}v_\gamma
=: \nabla_\beta \vec{v}_\alpha
\]
is called the covariant derivative of $\vec{v}_\alpha$.
It's projection of the derivative of $\vec{v}_\alpha$ onto
the tagent space.
\[
\pfr{}{u^\beta}\pfr{}{u^\gamma}(v_\alpha)
= \pfr{}{u^\gamma}\pfr{}{u^\beta}(v_\alpha)
\]
\[
\implies -\nabla_\beta\nabla_\gamma v_\alpha + \nabla_\gamma\nabla_\beta
v_\alpha = h_{\alpha\beta}\nabla_\gamma \vec{n} - h_{\alpha\gamma}
\nabla_\gamma \vec{n}.
\]
So the covariant derivative is not commutative,
and the ``curvature'' or the second
fundamental form basically measures this discommutation.

Now if we look at
\[
\pfr{g_{\delta\alpha}}{u^\beta} = \pfr{v_\delta\cdot v_\alpha}{u^\beta}
= \pfr{v_\delta}{u^\beta}v_\alpha + v_\delta \pfr{v_\alpha}{u^\beta}
= \sum_{\gamma}g_{\alpha\gamma}\Gamma^\gamma_{\_\delta\beta}
+ \sum_{\gamma} g_{\delta\gamma}\Gamma^\gamma_{\_\alpha\beta},
\]
similarly, by symmetry, computing
\[
\pfr{g_{\alpha\beta}}{u^\delta}, \quad \pfr{g_{\delta\beta}}{u^\alpha},
\]
will yield
\[
\Gamma^\gamma_{\_\alpha\beta} = \sum_{\delta} \frac{g^{\gamma\delta}}{2}
\left(\pfr{g_{\alpha\delta}}{u^\beta} + \pfr{g_{\delta\beta}}{u^\alpha}
- \pfr{g_{\alpha\beta}}{u^\delta}\right).
\]
In fact this is more intuitive in Einstein summation notation.

\subsection{Fundamental theorem of surface theory}
\label{sub:Fundamental theorem of surface theory}

\begin{theorem}[Fundamental theorem of surface theory]
    Let $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, $u=(u^1,u^2)$ is the coordinate.
	Let $g_{\alpha\beta}, h_{\alpha\beta}: D\to \mathbb{R}$ be
	$C^3$ functions, and the matrix $(g_{\alpha\beta})$
	is symmetrical anf positive definite,
	$(h_{\alpha\beta})$ is symmetrical.

	Let $g^{\alpha\beta}$ be the inverse matrix of $g_{\alpha\beta}$,
	and $R_{\delta\alpha\beta\gamma}$ is as above.
	If these functions satisfies Gauss equation and Codazzi equation,
	then:

	For all $p\in D$, exists a neighborhood $U = U(p) \subset D$ and
	a regular surface $\phi: U\to \mathbb{E}^3$, such that
	$g_{\alpha\beta}, h_{\alpha\beta}$ are the first and second
	fundamental quantities of $\phi$.

	Furthermore, if $\wt{\phi}: U\to \mathbb{E}^3$ also
	satisfies above conditions, then $\wt{\phi} = \sigma\circ \phi$,
	where $\sigma$ is an isometry of $\mathbb{E}^3$.
\end{theorem}

Basically we need to solve a partial differential equation,
and we need to consider how to construct this equation.

\begin{proof}[Proof]
    Let $\phi: U\to \mathbb{E}^3$,
	$v_\alpha, \vec{n}: D\to V(\mathbb{E}^3)$ be unknown functions
	satisfying
	\[
	\left\{
	\begin{aligned}
		v_\alpha &= \pfr{\phi}{u^\alpha}\\
		\pfr{v_\alpha}{u^\beta} &=
		\sum_\gamma \Gamma_{\_\alpha\beta}^\gamma v_\gamma
		+ h_{\alpha\beta}\vec{n}\\
		\pfr{\vec{n}}{u^\beta} &=
		- \sum_\gamma h_{\_\beta}^\gamma v_\gamma
	\end{aligned}\right.
	\]
	This is a linear homogeneous PDE of degree 1, and
	it actually has a unique solution.

	Consider the initial-value problem in the neighborhood of
	a given point $p\in D$.

	We hope to prove that
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The above PDE initial-value problem has a unique
			solution under the Gauss-Codazzi equations;
		\item If initially (i.e. at $p$) we have
			\[
			\vec{n} = \frac{v_1\times v_2}{\lVert v_1\times v_2 \rVert},
			\]
			then it holds for all $p'\in U(p)$.
	\end{itemize}

	For the second statement, we can compute
	$\pfr{}{u^\beta}(\vec{n}\cdot v_\alpha) = 0$,
	so they are constant.
\end{proof}
