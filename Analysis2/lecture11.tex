\section{Multi-dimensional Calculus}
\label{sec:Multi-dimensional Calculus}

In this section we'll generalize the differentiation and integration theory
to higher dimensions. Recall that Lebesgue integral is already
defined on higher dimensions, so here we mainly study the differentiation
of multi-dimensional functions.
