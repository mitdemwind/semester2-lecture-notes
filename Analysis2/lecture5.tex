\subsection{Applications of Fubini's theorem}
\label{sub:Applications of Fubini's theorem}

\begin{definition}[Product measure]
	Let $(X, \mathscr{F}, m)$ and $(Y, \mathscr{G}, m)$ be
	measure spaces, define a measure on $X\times Y$:
	The measure $m$ induces an outer measure on  $X\times Y$,
	and complete it to a normal measure by using
	Caratheodory conditions. This measure is called
	the \vocab{product measure} on $X\times Y$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $ \mathbb{R}^d = \mathbb{R}^{d_1}\times \mathbb{R}^{d_2}$,
	$E_1,E_2$ are subsets of $\mathbb{R}^{d_1}, \mathbb{R}^{d_2}$,
	respectively.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If $ E_1,E_2$ are measurable, then $E$ is measurable as well,
			and $m(E) = m(E_1)m(E_2)$.
		\item If $E$ is measurable, then  $E_1,E_2$ are measurable,
			and $m(E)=m(E_1)m(E_2)$, unless one of $E_1,E_2$ is null set,
			which means $E$ is null as well.
	\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
\begin{corollary}
    Let $f(x)$ be a measurable function on  $\mathbb{R}^{d_1}$,
	we have $g(x,y)=f(x)$ is measurable on  $\mathbb{R}^{d_2}$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proposition}
	Let $L$ be a linear map $\mathbb{R}^{d}\to \mathbb{R}^{d}$,
	$E \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$ a measurable set, then  $L(E)$ is measurable, and
	\[
	m(L(E)) = |\det L|m(E).
	\]
\end{proposition}

From this transformation formula we deduce the integral version:

Let $f$ be an integrable function on  $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, then
$f(L(x))$ is also integrable, and
\[
\int f(L(x)) = \frac{1}{|\det L|}\int f(x).
\]
Here we require $L\in \GL(n)$, since if  $\det L = 0$, the function
 $f(L(x))$ need not be measurable.

 At last we take a look at Fubini's theorem with the convolution product.
